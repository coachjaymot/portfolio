  <h1>Imagery Script for Tennis Performance</h1>

  <p>
    Below is a sample visualization script that a novice to intermediate tennis player can use to enhance their performance through mental imagery. The scenario is a private tennis lesson with a personal tennis coach. The skill that is being focused on is the forehand.
  </p>

  <h2>Imagery Script:</h2>
  <p>
    As I get ready to rally with my personal coach, Jeff, I get into the ready position with my feet shoulder width apart and my knees slightly bent. As I get into this stance, I begin hopping up and down about an inch off the floor with a slight side to side bounce, making sure that my favorite pair of white tennis shoes is never glued to the floor. I am positioned along the baseline, a white line separating the blue playing surface from the green exterior surface. I have both hands on the racket handle. My right hand is gripping the bottom of the handle, and my left hand is gripping the top half.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As coach Jeff feeds me a ball, I hear the ball pop off the string bed of his brown Wilson racket. I know that it is coming to my forehand. As I track the flight of the ball, I begin to turn so that my body is positioned side to target prior to the ball reaching my side of the net. My left hand lets go of the top half of the handle as I take one big step towards the ball. I feel my left heel leave the ground on the first step as I push off of the ground with my tense calf. This is followed by several smaller, choppy steps as I approach the ball. I hear my white tennis shoes squeak as my small steps shuffle across the floor. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As I close in on the ball, I try to slow my momentum down so that my final steps are my back foot hitting the floor followed by my front foot. I simultaneously feel myself cocking my racket back to assure I could swing with power and speed. As I begin to swing, the racket dips below my hips and begins to head towards my opposite shoulder. Right when my racket is parallel to the net, I make contact with the ball. I begin to brush up on the ball. I feel the light brown strings of the string bed on my blue Babalot racket grab the yellow felt of the Penn tennis ball as I brush up and over the ball. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My brown eyes lock in on my racket hitting the tennis ball as I hear it pop off of my tennis racket. The racket loosely swings over my opposite shoulder as my back foot swings forward. I watch as the ball lands right beyond the service line. I feel successful as I think about how Coach Jeff emphasizes the importance of hitting the ball deep into the court. I quickly reflect on how hitting the ball beyond the service line was the goal. I hear Coach Jeff yell, “good job, nice depth” in his deep and raspy voice. I then backpedal back to the baseline and get back into my ready position.
