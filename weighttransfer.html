    <h1>Weight Transfer</h1>
    <p>
Everyone explains weight transfer a little differently and below is a link that connects us to feeltennis.net for a helpful tennis tip. The article identifies different stances and you will notice that terminology is not always normalized in the tennis world. What I refer to as closed stance, which is essentially turning your body side to target, is referred to as the neutral stance in the article. I always teach novice tennis players to get into the closed stance as it allows for good weight transfer and emphasizes that as we move our feet we plant our back foot first, followed by our front foot. This is the beginning of the kinetic chain (always starts from the ground-up) for a solid groundstroke. By making contact with our back foot first, then our front foot, we ensure our momentum is transferred forward (assuming our side is to target). Once we get that basis of weight transfer down, we often stack elements to ensure that everything works in synergy. For example, we want to be balanced and our knees slighlty bent about shoulder width apart. As we are performing this back-foot, front foot transfer of weight we are also performing the unit turn or the coiling and uncoiling of our upper half. We then connect this with drawing the backswing, which some simply cock the racket back while others believe in the loop motion (or drawing a "C"). Then we enter the swing phase in which we want to swing low to high or from our hip to the opposite shoulder and we should brush up on the ball (pronate the wrist - the motion is similar to the windshield wiper motion of a car), making contact slighlty out in front of us and to the side, and finish by following through.
