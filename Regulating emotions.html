  <h1>Emotional Regulation Strategies</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Below are a few emotional regulation strategies that I find useful:</p>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
      <p>Berner et al. (2009) define mindfulness as the “nonjudgemental focus of one’s attention on the experience that occurs in the present moment.” Mindfulness encourages the acceptance of thoughts (including unwanted thoughts) and commitment to action rather than fighting negative thoughts and unpleasant emotions (Berner et al., 2009; Krane & Williams, 2015).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Reframing</h3>
      <p>Cognitive restructuring, also known as reframing, is a cognitive technique for dealing with negative thoughts or negative self-talk and is the process in which an individual creates alternative ways of looking at the world (Williams, Zinsser, & Bunker, 2015).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Countering</h3>
      <p>Countering is another method described as an internal dialogue that uses facts and reasoning to refute the beliefs leading to negative thoughts (Williams, Zinsser, & Bunker, 2015).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Deep Breathing</h3>
      <p>Positive Coaching Alliance (n.d.) states that deep breathing is a great way to reduce anxiety and stress responses, increase oxygen levels, calm the nervous system, and reduce tension.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Emotional Intelligence and Awareness</h3>
      <p>Sterrett and Jansen (2015) discuss emotional intelligence as the ability to know one’s own emotions and understand others’ emotions and intentions. Sports require composure when faced with adversity. Athletes must be self-aware and mature enough to regulate their emotions. The inverted U theory (Williams & Reifsteck, 2017) helps understand that performance is best at moderate arousal levels and declines if arousal is too low or high.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>As an athlete, I had an extreme fear of failure, particularly in basketball. My anxiety levels were debilitating to my performance in sports. As I learned cognitive techniques, I got better in the sport. As I got into coaching, I believe the fear of failure transferred over. Coaches are the leaders of a team and when a team does poorly, they are often the first ones to blame. Over time, I focused on task-oriented goals, became a better coach, and stressors became less relevant. Much of stress in sports comes from winning and losing, ego-oriented goal orientation, and external judgment, which can cause anger, frustration, or a fixed mindset in both coaches and athletes.</p>

    <h2>Emotional Regulation Plan for Coaching Practice</h2>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Good to use during preparation periods as preparation periods allow for us to accept our thoughts and/or realities and create a plan of action that we can commit to.</li>
        <li>Great to use during highly stressful moments during games and when distractions are present. Can help bring back focus and drown out the “noise.”</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Reframing and Countering</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Great to use during emotional highs or lows.</li>
        <li>Great to use when emotional awareness is high and the recognition of negative thoughts or emotions is present.</li>
        <li>Great to use when trying to understand someone else’s reality (such as an athlete’s).</li>
        <li>Applicable in-game, in practice, or general settings.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Deep Breathing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use for moments of high arousal that cause extreme stress, frustration or tension.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Emotional Awareness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Emotional awareness is always important, but especially when experiencing extreme sadness, anger or frustration. Understanding my emotional state can help me reflect on whether or not my thoughts are rational or irrational. This can lead to the other techniques, such as reframing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box">
      <h3>Application and Reflection</h3>
      <p>I have used many of these strategies, and they have truly made me a better coach. I remember coaching in environments where coaches felt that the situation was hopeless and for a brief period, I felt hopeless too. But eventually, I used mindfulness and decided to commit to action rather than give up. The actions I committed to were the small wins. The small tasks that we could be successful at, and these small tasks did end up in big wins later, but it just took some time! Reframing and countering also did wonders for me. I often create positive alternatives when I coach, and I do so more vocally now since I am providing private lessons. Sometimes this can be extremely uplifting for my clients and for myself. I do not perform deep breathing enough, but I will try it moving forward. Hopefully it will provide me some relief from stress!</p>
