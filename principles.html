<h2>PRINCIPLES</h2>

<p>As one explores and reviews the large amount of information that is available in regards to the foundations and guidelines of weight training it becomes readily apparent that nothing is etched in stone. It seems that almost every author, equipment company or health studio has their own list of principles, rules, laws or guidelines upon which they hang their hat.</p>

<p>In this chapter reference is made to five basic principles that the author feels are sound from a scientific viewpoint. It is believed by this author that everything else comes under the heading of general rules to follow, recommended guidelines, or program design variables. It is not felt that these five are "The Principles" exclusively; they simply seem to be right and "flow" from one to the other in an orderly, scientific progression.</p>

<h3>I. Overload Principle:</h3>
<p>The proper, scientific application of a progressive resistance weight training program is based upon the Overload Principle. The Overload Principle simply means that the systems (such as the musculature system) upon which the training stresses are being applied will respond and grow as a result of being overloaded beyond the level of training that has already been attained. In order to be effective the overload should be well planned and used over an extended period of time.</p>

<p>An example of the application of overload can be illustrated in the use of a 3 x 10 program in the general conditioning phase of training. When the individual is able to do all three sets of an exercise with ten reps with "x" amount of weight, then the poundage is moved up on the next workout by ten or twenty pounds. The muscles are, therefore, overloaded beyond the level they had reached the last workout. In response to the new overload, the body will adapt and overcompensate.</p>

<h3>II. Overcompensation Principle:</h3>
<p>As the body is overloaded it begins to adapt and overcompensate to the stress placed upon it in anticipation of a continued environment that will require adaptation in order to function effectively. A classic example of a very visible adaptation to external stress is the build-up of calluses on the hands when a person does a lot of physical work with their hands. Another example of overcompensation is the oxygen carrying capacity of a person's blood supply as they move from a low altitude to a high altitude. The body begins to adapt by increasing the number of hemoglobin as a result of living in the "thinner air".</p>

<p>In regard to weight training and the resulting overcompensation to the applied overload, the body responds in several ways depending upon the intensity of the load.</p>

<p>There is an increase in the cross sectional size of the muscle fiber due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an increase in the number of myofibrils as a result (current thought) of longitudinal splitting (MacDougall, 1992).</li>
<li>There is an increase in the number of actin and myosin filaments (MacDougall, 1992).</li>
<li>There is an increase in the size of the existing contractile elements (actin and myosin filaments) (MacDougall, 1992).</li>
<li>There is an increase in the amount of interstitial connective tissue (however, it is minimal in regards to the total size growth of muscle fiber) (MacDougall, 1992).</li>
<li>There is an increase in the volume of interstitial fluids and enzymes (MacDougall, 1992).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is actually a decrease in mitochondrial density and capillary density when there is hypertrophy resulting from moderate or heavy training programs. These type of programs are generally associated with lifters who compete in the sports of Powerlifting or Weightlifting. The routines are high intensity and low volume. (*Although capillary and mitochondrial density lessens in muscles hypertrophied through high intensity, low volume weight training regimens the author cannot find reference as to whether there still may be an increase in the number of capillaries and mitochondria despite a drop in density).</p>

<p>Various studies (Tesch, 1992) and resultant findings indicate that endurance type weight training programs (low intensity, high volume) such as that characterized by most body builders may result in capillary and mitochondrial proliferation.</p>

<p>Muscle fiber that was dormant or under used is recruited, which results in additional size and strength growth.</p>

<p>Bone and connective tissue are modified and strengthened through strength training (Stone, 1992):</p>
<ul>
<li>Bone structure under stress will gain in mass and density, thus gaining strength.</li>
<li>Connective tissue will experience some micro-tearing. The rebuilding and healing process results in more and stronger connective tissue.</li>
<li>Tendons and ligaments will gain in size and strength.</li>
</ul>

<h3>III. SAID Principle:</h3>
<p>"Specific Adaptation To Imposed Demands" is a principle that deals with specificity of training. It refers to the fact that the training program must be specific in demands in order to obtain the desired results because the body will respond specifically to the training regimen. This principle is the basis for the selection of the variables of program design such as exercise selection, exercise order, intensity, volume, and frequency.</p>

<h3>IV. Overtraining/Undertraining Principle:</h3>
<p>Overtraining can be just as inhibiting to a person's program (and sometimes more deleterious) than undertraining. Overtraining simply means that a person is working too hard (either by too many high intensity workouts in succession, or too many workouts for a given muscle groups in a given time period or both) and thus creating too much fatigue which then hinders recovery between workout sessions. Proper recovery between workout sessions is essential to growth and strength gains.</p>

<p>Overtraining can take place in one of many ways. It may involve excessively working one body part (e.g. biceps of the arms) or simply not listening to one's body signals (fatigue, sore muscles, joint pain) and proceeding with a scheduled workout when perhaps another day off may be best. The result could be a muscle tear or tendon aggravation or a general, slow decline of energy and strength.</p>

<p>Undertraining simply means that the individual is not training often enough and/or hard enough to produce the desired results.</p>

<p>A general guideline that will aid a lifter in avoiding overtraining/undertraining is what is referred to as the 48 hour / 96 hour rule. The concept is that the lifter will allow at least 48 hours between workouts for any one muscle group but not more than 96 hours. It is not set in concrete and means different things to different people (the beginning person who has been training for six months versus the advanced lifter who has been training for five years). Never-the-less, although there are numerous exceptions, the 48/96 rule is a good general rule to implement in one's program (especially for the beginner).</p>

<h3>V. Reversibility Principle:</h3>
<p>The reversibility principle refers to the fact that there will be a reversal of training gains at some point in time when a person discontinues his/her training program. The reversibility factor is highly individualistic but is primarily dependent upon the experience and background of the lifter. The person who has been training for several years, for example, will not be affected by a one-month layoff the same way that a person who has been training for only six months.</p>
