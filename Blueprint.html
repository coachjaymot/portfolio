      Below is a chart that includes five separate domains that categorize important attributes that great teams and individuals possess. I believe that these attributes are worth developing and being shared and can play a vital role in developing successful teams and individuals. When approaching the teaching and development of these skills, I begin by having a command style of coaching and once there is buy-in from my teams I slowly convert them to a more autonomous driven machine where the coach no longer has to be the driving/guiding force and the players can guide themselves. The coach can then focus more on player development, tactical aspects, and planning of the sport and less on the development of culture and mindset of his/her team.

    <!-- Mental Attributes -->
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental">Mental, Psychological, & Emotional Intelligence Attributes</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Motivation</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must be driven towards a goal or an objective. I like to believe that these goals should be attainable, small, incremental goals that are like small tasks on a checklist that lead to a bigger goal. I emphasize task-orientation in practice and believe that short term tasks and goals lead to mastery and ultimately success. I avoid ego-orientation or the win-at-all costs mentality because individuals are likely to quit if they experience failure with this mindset and the last thing a coach or individual wants is quitting to become a habit on their team. It is also best to emphasize an intrinsic approach when working with athletes. Extrinsic rewards will only motivate so much and when these extrinsic rewards disappear, athletes will no longer be motivated to perform at a high level. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Grit</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must develop the ability to persevere through hardships, challenges and barriers that stand between us and our goals.

</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Resilience</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must develop the ability to bounce back after receiving results that were not ideal or favorable.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Socio-emotional Management</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must be able to manage ourselves socially and emotionally in order to make logical decisions that will benefit us individually and as a team. We must learn techniques that stop negative thoughts, such as thought stoppage and reframing, in order to help regulate our emotions. We must learn positive self-talk and coping mechanisms to deal with situations or circumstances that are not favorable. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Arousal Regulation</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must understand how arousal affects how we perform and use this knowledge to perform at a high level.</div>

      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Self-Efficacy</div>

    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Decision Making</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We are a direct result of the compilation of decisions that we make.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Ambition</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must have a strong desire to achieve something and the ability to work towards our goals without being forced or obligated.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Knowledge & Competence</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Knowledge must be developed, and coaches and players must develop knowledge in order to share it with one another. This encompasses a wide breadth of knowledge, including sport-specific tactical knowledge, technical knowledge, physical knowledge, psychological knowledge and much more. </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Internalization</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must be willing to accept and internalize that we contribute to a team or individual performance regardless of whether it is a success or a failure. Many people externalize failure or poor performances and blame others for negative results, and this externalization is not a good approach. We should not disassociate with our team just because we experienced a failure.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Independence</div>

    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain mental"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Autonomy</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must be able to guide ourselves in positive ways. We must teach individuals and teams to be able to self-direct. We must be able to make positive choices and follow our choices by taking ownership of our actions.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Character Attributes -->
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain character">Character and Value Attributes</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Positionality</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must learn where we come from, where one another comes from, and the experiences that have shaped us to understand what we value and how we frame the world.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain character"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Character</div>

      <div class="chart-cell domain character"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Commitment & Dedication</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must not only be committed to one another, but we must be committed to our goals, dreams, and the process. Commitment to the process or devoting ourselves to a greater cause is dedication. We must be dedicated to a purpose and willing to put forth our best effort towards reaching our goals for long durations of time.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain character"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Discipline</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">The practice of following what we said we’d do long after the feeling we said it in has left. Discipline is the ability to follow through with actions that lead us closer to our goals regardless of how we feel in the present.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain character"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Accountability</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must hold ourselves accountable for our actions.</div>

      <div class="chart-cell domain character"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Reliability</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Consistent and trustworthy behavior.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain character"></div>

    <!-- Physical Attributes -->
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain physical">Physical Attributes</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Physical Ability</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must develop our bodies for the sport that we are competing in. Physical ability allows us a competitive advantage over an opponent.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain physical"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Technical Skills Mastery</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">The most skilled teams often experience success and developing the technical skills that will help reach objectives in a contest are vital to competition.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain physical"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Physical Fitness</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must develop our conditioning and be able to go longer than our opponents. This will give teams a competitive advantage.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain physical"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Sweat Equity</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">There is no substitution for work-ethic. We must work hard to get better, master skills, and develop strength and fitness.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Community Attributes -->
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community">Community Attributes</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Culture and Climate</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">The culture takes precedence over everything. Culture is a way of life. Culture is a set of norms and acceptable behaviors and attitudes. I find this to be one of the most important attributes a team can have because individuals will follow the herd. The herd will teach what behaviors are acceptable and if this is set to a high performing level, individual members will understand that performing at a high level is the status quo. The climate is what is the overall prevailing status quo and coaches and players need to shape this status quo.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Role Modeling</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Many people believe that they can do what people from similar backgrounds  have done. They believe that if someone that was within proximity of me has accomplished it, I can accomplish it too. Role Modeling (particularly for younger individuals) shows them where the ceiling is. Role Modeling is also a strong tool to use when shaping the culture. I like to discuss this with older/returning team members as their behaviors and attitudes communicate what is acceptable to younger/newer team members.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Collaboration</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must be willing to work with others to achieve shared goals.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Loyalty</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must know that the people we work with will not leave us hanging. Loyalty is an undying commitment to other people and the strongest teams are loyal to one another.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Caring</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">I believe that if a person truly cares about others that they will do their best even when they do not feel like it. When you have a team full of people that truly care, they will always find a way to make it work. Caring is a prerequisite to having a strong team because caring is the glue that keeps everyone coming back to one another.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Support</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">When you are on a team or a part of any kind of sports community it is important to find a village of people that support you and your goals. Having people to lean on or people who have shared goals is important in a person’s continued commitment towards greatness. I find the cohort model to work well in education as people are more likely to finish a program if they are surrounded by people in similar situations that are striving for the same goal. When possible, I think the cohort model for sports is a great way to foster support.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Presence</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">There is value in listening and engaging with others. We get the most out of our experiences when we are fully present in mind, body and spirit.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Unity</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Working toward shared goals and having shared values strengthens the bond between members of the team.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Network</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">The more people you are willing to work with, the more opportunity comes your way.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain community"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Goals</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Without goals we are floating through life without purpose. Complacency leads to the stagnation of growth and coaches and athletes need to constantly create short term and long term goals in order to attain continuous growth.</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Process & Growth Attributes -->
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain process">Process & Growth Attributes</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Habits & Routines</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">We must develop routines or patterns of behavior that have a positive impact on our lives and others.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain process"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Differentiation</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Tailor practices, training sessions and learnable components to the needs of your athletes. Everyone learns differently and differentiation is an important tool to ensure that all members of a team are learning.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain process"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Resourcefulness</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">The ability to find solutions in the face of obstacles. Another way to look at this is the ability to find a way to make a positive impact regardless of the circumstances or in the words of Arthur Ashe, “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain process"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Praise</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">As an educator, “Growth Mindset” became one of the most commonly used approaches to getting students to believe that abilities and intelligence can develop over time. This was coined by Carol Dweck. I found that one of Carol Dweck’s earlier works was the precursor to Growth Mindset and this observed praise. Young children who were praised for effort were more likely to accept challenges and persevere. This was the opposite of children who were praised for innate abilities (such as intelligence) who often quit when challenged because they would not be praised for their abilities if they failed. How coaches decide to praise their athletes has a huge influence on their mindset and their desire to persevere through challenges.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-row">
      <div class="chart-cell domain process"></div>
      <div class="chart-cell">Reflection</div>
      <div class="chart-cell">The ability to look back on what has been done and think critically about what worked well and what has room for improvement and what adaptations or adjustments can be made to make something better.</div>
