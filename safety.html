  <h1>SAFETY</h1>
  <p>Weight Training Safety Guidelines and Best Practices</p>
</section>

<!-- ================= CONTENT ================= -->
<section class="content">
  <div class="section">
    <p>Weight Training is generally considered to be a safe activity. Regardless of which category a person fits into (Powerlifting, Weightlifting, Bodybuilding, Rehabilitation, Strength Conditioning for Athletics, or General Fitness), the ratio of injuries to total number of participants is very low. As one considers the various internal and external factors that pertain to safety in weight training, it should be noted that almost all problems arise from human error or lack of knowledge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Breathing</h2>
    <p>Correct breathing is essential while lifting weights or doing any type of resistive training. A systematic approach when examining the use of correct breathing is to start with the beginner who essentially begins with the bar, look at the intermediate level lifter who is training in the moderate intensity range, and then to look at the veteran trainer who exerts a maximal or near maximal effort while lifting heavy lifts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>General Rule</h2>
    <p>The proper breathing pattern while training with weights is to exhale when lifting the weights up against gravity and to inhale while lowering the weights down with gravity. During the exhaling pattern the muscles are contracting concentrically (shortening) and during the inhaling pattern the muscles are contracting eccentrically (lengthening). Slang terms often used by lifters are the words "positive" and "negative". Positive correlates to the exhalation phase while negative correlates to the inhalation phase. An important point to remember is that the lifter should use common sense while lifting and should not hold his/her breath for an extended period of time.</p>
    <p>The proper breathing pattern lessens (does not prevent) a rise in arterial blood pressure, helps to maintain a flow of oxygen to the brain (which would help to prevent fainting), and facilitates a stronger effort during the concentric phase of the lift.</p>
    <p>The idea of not holding one's breath while lifting or going through a full range of motion is a good concept. However, in reality lifters often hold their breath because that is a natural, protective reaction to lifting heavy weight. As a person gets stronger and begins to lift heavier weights he/she will need to exert a stronger force. The lifter will then initiate what is referred to as the Valsalva Maneuver or a Valsalva.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Valsalva Maneuver</h2>
    <p>The valsalva maneuver is a natural part of heavy lifting or maximum efforts (either endurance or 1RM) and is a technique that a person will often automatically use without even consciously trying to do so. The Valsalva Maneuver is a forced exhalation against a closed glottis (the glottis is the narrowest part of the larynx through which air passes into and out of the trachea). When a lifter is executing an extremely heavy lift or is nearing the last couple of repetitions in an extended endurance set he/she will naturally take in air and then hold his/her breath at the start of the lift.</p>
    <p>The positive aspects of the Valsalva are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pressure within the abdominal cavity is increased. This pressure is referred to as "intra-abdominal pressure" (IAP). An increase in IAP gives added support to the muscles that support the vertebral column resulting in increased support for the vertebral column.</li>
      <li>Pressure within the chest cavity is increased. This pressure is referred to as "intra-thoracic pressure" (ITP). An increase in ITP gives added support to the muscles that support the vertebral column resulting in increased support for the vertebral column.</li>
      <li>Mechano-receptors within muscle tissue are "triggered" as the result of the increased IAP and ITP and resultant preparation for additional effort which facilitates a greater effort. In other words, the body is put on "alert" and prepares to exert a greater force to complete a task.</li>
      <li>Stabilization of cerebrospinal fluid pressures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The negative aspects of the Valsalva are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A greatly increased blood pressure.</li>
      <li>A resultant reduction of Oxygen to the brain which can lead to the lifter fainting during the effort.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the lifter initiates a Valsalva and then holds his/her breath throughout the full motion of a repetition he/she is using what is referred to as a "Full Valsalva."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Partial Valsalva</h2>
    <p>The partial valsalva is a technique whereby the lifter initiates valsalva at the start of the lift, but then exhales as soon as he/she has gone past the sticking point. Perhaps an example of lifting during a fairly heavy bench press attempt will clarify the method for using a partial valsalva. At the start of the bench press with free weights the lifter has taken the bar out of the rack and is holding it above the chest with arms fully extended. He/she would then inhale and take in a full breath of air. He/she would then hold that breath (valsalva) during the lowering of the bar to the chest and then back up to a point five or six inches above the chest which is approximately where the level of the sticking point is located. As soon as the bar is above or beyond the sticking point and leverage becomes easier the lifter will exhale (partial valsalva).</p>
    <p>The sticking point is usually just past the halfway point in the full range of motion of a repetition. The use of a partial valsalva enables the lifter to avoid holding their breath for an extended period of time and thus avoids driving the blood pressure up any higher than is necessary and also avoids the possibility of fainting.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he/she can take advantage of the positives that the valsalva maneuver offers to the lifter which are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An increase in IAP.</li>
      <li>An increase in ITP.</li>
      <li>Stimulation of mechanoreceptors.</li>
      <li>A transfer of the ITP "to the cerebrospinal fluid so that cerebrospinal pressure increases to match that in the thorax and abdomen. This may represent an important protective mechanism by reducing transmural pressure across cerebral vessels and thus reducing the risk of vascular damage under the extremes of pressure encountered with this form of exercise."</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Breathing During Maximal Efforts (1RM)</h2>
    <p>During maximal efforts lifters will often use a "Full Valsalva". A full valsalva refers to the fact that a lifter will hold his/her breath throughout the full range of motion of a repetition. This is NOT a recommended technique to be used by novice lifters in the general fitness mode or for general physical education weight training classes. It is, however, a technique that advanced, competitive lifters will use in maximal efforts as it affords maximum effort, stabilization, and support. It is not without its hazards. The author has seen Weightlifters pass out in competitive lifting meets on more than one occasion. Often lifters will "black out" for a split second in the middle of a lift and still recover and go on to complete the lift. Also, lifters who have passed out and fallen with a weight often come back on their next attempt and successfully complete the same or even heavier weight.</p>
    <p>Advanced, competitive lifters learn through practice how to use the full valsalva. Their bodies adjust to the demands of the heavy lifts. They "learn" to anticipate, discover their limits and become proficient at using a full valsalva. The novice lifter should be taught to not use the full valsalva. It is a trial and error process that takes a significant period of time for a person to learn how to handle the full valsalva.</p>
    <p>Sooner or later a person who is training with weights is going to have to hold his/her breath. Whether it is a 1RM or a few reps being forced out at the end of an endurance set the lifter will use the valsalva to aid him/her in putting out a greater effort. The important thing to do is to use the partial valsalva to take advantage of the positive aspects of valsalva and to minimize the negative points.</p>
    <p>The reader should keep in mind that no matter where the starting position is for an exercise, the inhalation takes place at that time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overtraining</h2>
    <p>Major "accidents or injuries (such as a torn muscle or tendon) are not very common in the weight room. However, there seem to be a great number of minor or moderate injuries that do add up to a lot of "lost" time and set-backs. These minor or moderate injuries are almost always the result of overtraining.</p>
    <p>Overtraining usually results in a minor muscle tear or tendon aggravation. Tendinitis is very common, especially in the elbow and shoulder joints. The overtraining is usually the result of simply using too much weight or of doing too many sets and reps or a combination of too many sets, reps and weight.</p>
    <p>Typical scenarios leading to overtraining are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overuse of negative (eccentric movements) training, forced reps or cheating movements.</li>
      <li>Ignoring a pain and trying to work through the pain to "work-out" the injury. After cool down, the injury usually manifests itself to the lifter.</li>
      <li>Failure to follow the general conditioning program long enough to prepare the body for the harder work to come when the person enters into the individual program.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Spotting</h2>
    <p>In the author's opinion there are only two (2) main exercises which should be spotted in the weight room for absolute safety reasons: the Bench Press and the Back Squat. There are numerous other lifts that can be spotted and a few that should not be spotted. Regarding lifts that should not be spotted the lifters either need to lower the amount of weight being lifted or learn how to drop the weight correctly.</p>
    <p>The bench press is probably the most dangerous lift in the weight room due to the weight being over the neck and chest area. Even an empty bar dropped on the neck can result in a fatality. The back squat should be spotted by someone with a good squatting background and who possesses adequate strength for the situation. A person doing any heavy lifting should always lift with a partner and, preferably, with two people. The lifter is responsible for returning the weights to the starting position. The spotter is to assist the lifter.</p>
    <p>Use spotters appropriate to the lift. A person bench pressing a great amount of weight should use a spotter strong enough to give a proper assist if the lift is missed. For heavy 1RM attempts, experienced primary and secondary spotters should be used. The lifter is depending upon the spotter for his/her safety and needs the full attention of the spotter.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>General Rules</h2>
    <p>Proper Attire is essential toward a good mental attitude. If a lifter comes to the weight room poorly dressed, it is often a reflection of his/her general attitude. Poor attitude people tend to be a drag on the attitudes of the whole class and tend to either cause injuries to others or are more susceptible to injuries themselves. They tend to not pay attention to detail, to neatness, to the interests of others, and to class regulations.</p>
    <p>Shoes must be worn. Besides obvious sanitary reasons, shoes will also help to cut down on the extent of an injury if a weight falls onto a person's foot.</p>
    <p>Weight Lifting Belt. Contrary to the thinking of most weight trainers and the teaching of a vast number of teachers and trainers a weight belt is not essential. The primary purpose of a weight belt is to provide a firmer wall against which the lifter can breathe. The result will be greater IAP and ITP which, as already discussed earlier in this chapter, will provide greater and essential vertebral support. The weight belt is really there to reduce the abdominal cavity (by tightening the belt around the waist) which, in turn, results in greater pressure generated within the abdominal cavity. In fact, if a trainer who is in sound health and who has no immediate physical reasons to use a belt insists on using a belt he/she will actually be creating a problem. The problem will be that the belt will become a crutch and a substitute for development of critical strength in the supportive muscles in the upper torso. Back extensor and abdominal muscles will not develop and become as strong if a belt is used all of the time.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of instances where the use of a weight lifting belt is probably necessary and definitely serves a purpose. For the person who already has some sort of problem anatomically with their back the belt can be of assistance in helping them to maintain proper posture while lifting. That person should still be cautious about the amount of weight they are using because the belt is not a substitute for proper form while lifting or adequate strength.</p>
    <p>For the person who is doing a maximal squat or overhead lift, or multiple rep heavy squatting (80 to 85% and up intensity level) and overhead lifting the belt then becomes an added safety margin for the lifter.</p>
    <p>One other very important point for the teacher to take into account is liability. Do not prevent a student from wearing a weight belt if they insist on using one. Take the time to point out to them the reasons for the use of one in the first place, the role of the upper torso muscles for back strength, and then let them use it if they feel the need for using one.</p>
    <p>Sanitary Conditions: Proper personal hygiene (clean clothes and clean bodies) is essential with the great number of people who use the weight lifting apparatus.</p>
    <p>Horseplay: Horseplay is not a part of a weight room's atmosphere; lifters must know where others are at all times to avoid accidents. Be courteous to others and respect their program.</p>
    <p>Technique: Proper lifting technique is essential to making progress toward avoiding injuries. Proper head alignment with the spine, protection of the lower back, correct breathing, and correct path of the bar are the key points to follow.</p>
    <p>Apparatus Condition: The condition of the equipment being used (cables, bolts, pulley wheels) should be checked prior to every lifting session.</p>
    <p>Room Hygiene: The floor and pads (sit-up boards, benches, chairs, stools and seats) should be mopped daily with a disinfectant.</p>
    <p>Personal Health History: Instructors need to know if a person under their supervision has a health problem or prior injuries that could be a problem for that particular person while training with weights. A system should be in place (such as the use of a Par Q [participant questionnaire]) that will enable the instructor to be informed. Often times individuals are embarrassed about a problem and communicating with those persons through some vehicle such as a questionnaire works pretty well.</p>
    <p>Circulation Problems: Circulation problems or any heart related problems should be discussed. Weight training puts a great deal of strain on the cardiovascular system and the weight trainer may be headed for some serious problems by being involved with a lifting program. That person may possibly benefit much more from an aerobic program that offers a steady state type of exercise rather than a lifting program that involves great sudden changes of pulse rate and arterial pressure. This does not mean that a person with heart disease should not participate in a lifting program. It does mean they should explore some other fitness ideas and/or use extreme caution in the choice of intensity or of breathing techniques while lifting.</p>
    <p>Blood Sugar Problems: If you are diabetic or have hypoglycemia, then you must be very conscious of your diet and the regulation of your blood sugar. Weight training is an anaerobic activity that relies on short bursts of energy from the ATP-PC system. It will tax your glycogen supply and could upset your system as the body reacts to the training and makes adjustments to the demands being placed upon it. It is advisable to under-train rather than over-train until the body has been able to adapt to a weight training regimen.</p>
    <p>Diet and Rest
In general, everyone who trains with weights should be very conscious of their eating habits and rest.
It makes good sense to eat something before a person lifts, but not too soon prior to lifting. Two to four hours prior to lifting is recommended. If nothing is eaten prior to lifting, the energy supply will probably be knocked out of balance (low blood sugar). If the lifter eats too soon prior to lifting and attempts to lift on a full stomach, he/she may tax their circulatory-system's ability to handle the increased demands of blood flow to the musculature system, as well as aid in food digestion and supply an adequate amount of blood to the brain. There may be a decrease in blood sugar to the brain and the final result could be nausea, cold sweat, dizziness, and a reduced capacity for work.
Adequate rest is essential toward making positive progress in a strength conditioning program. Even though a person may function in a weight training class on less than adequate sleep, he/she will not have the drive and energy to put forth a top effort for that day's lifting session.
</p>
<p>Attitude
Students should not approach class with a haphazard attitude; respect for others who are in the class should be a part of their thought process. Students should think about the safety of others as well as their own safety. Almost all accidents in the weight room are due to human error; error that is a result of either poor lifting technique, improper breathing, poor spotting or simply negligence due to a lack of a "safe" attitude.
